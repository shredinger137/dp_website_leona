<p class="style1">An older, tired-looking dog wandered into my yard. I  could tell from his collar and well-fed belly that he had a home and was well  ta ken care of. &nbsp;He calmly came over to me, I gave him a few pats on his  head, he then followed me into my house, slowly walked down the hall, curled up in the corner and fell asleep. </p>
<p align="center" class="style1"><img src="../images/sleep.jpg" width="497" height="278" alt="pup" /></p>
<p class="style1">An hour later, he went to the door, and I let him out.  The next day he was back, greeted me in my yard, walked inside and resumed his  spot in the hall and again slept for about an hour. This continued off and on  for several weeks. Curious I pinned a note to his collar: 'I would like to find  out who the owner of this wonderful sweet dog is and ask if you are aware that  almost every afternoon your dog comes to my house for a nap.' The next day he  arrived for his nap, with a different note pinned to his collar: 'He lives in a  home with 6 children, 2 under the age of 3 - he's trying to catch up on his  sleep. Can I come with him tomorrow?' </p>
